## Our History

Founded by passionate Colombian students who recognized the need for a cultural home away from home, CUCOL has grown into one of Cambridge's most vibrant cultural societies. Our journey began with a small group of students sharing arepas and stories, and has evolved into a comprehensive support network that spans undergraduate, graduate, and alumni communities.
